<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year Master student at the Large Model Research Center, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the guidance of Associate Professors  [Dr. Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tVeCxZcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Dr. Yi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iga8Z4AAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am also supervised by [Prof. Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7_BkyxEAAAAJ&hl=en). I got my Bachelor's degree from Department of Automation, Tsinghua University. My undergraduate thesis about Operations Optimization was completed under the supervision of [Prof. Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rw6vWdcAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests include multimodal deep learning, with a particular focus on vision-language alignment, large language models, benchmarks, and dataset development. I have completed three comprehensive research projects, each culminating in a paper<img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations">. I also have sufficient experence dealing with MLLM's coding environment and finetuning.  

(2025.01) NOW I am seeking a PhD position in Fall, 2025. I am also looking for a Research Assistant position in this year.
